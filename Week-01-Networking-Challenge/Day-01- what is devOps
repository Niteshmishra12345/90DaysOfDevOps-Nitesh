# Day 1-what is DevOps why DevOps & its History

## What I Learned today:

## 1. what is devOps 
. DevOps is a combination of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aims to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
Its goal is to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better collaboration across teams.

## 2. Why DevOps:

### Before DevOps (Old Way):

.Developers wrote code → passed to Operations → tested → deployed (slow & risky).
.Teams worked in silos → no shared responsibility.
.Releases took weeks or months.
.Blame games when something failed in production.

### After DevOps (Modern Way):

.Development, Testing, and Operations work together.
.Everything is automated: testing, integration, deployment.
.Software is delivered in hours or days, not weeks.
.Bugs are caught early → systems are more stable.
.Focus on continuous improvement and fast feedback.

## Waterfall Model – The Traditional Software Development Model:

###The Waterfall Model is one of the oldest and simplest models in software development.
It follows a linear and sequential approach — like water flowing downward through steps (that’s why it's called "waterfall").

Requirements
     ↓
Design
     ↓
Implementation
     ↓
Testing
     ↓
Deployment
     ↓
Maintenance

### Drawbacks of the Waterfall Model:
Problem                                                            	Why It Matters
❌ Inflexible	                                                 Can't adapt to changing requirements
❌ Late Testing	                                               Bugs found too late in the process
❌ Delayed Feedback	                                           No real user input during development
❌ Risk of Failure                                           	If one phase fails, whole project is delayed or wasted 

## History of DevOps:

1. Before 2000, developers and operations worked separately — causing delays and miscommunication.
2. In 2008, the term “DevOps” was coined after a conference by Patrick Debois.
3. DevOps emerged from the need to bridge the gap between development and IT operations.
4. It promotes collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and delivery (CI/CD).
5. Today, DevOps is a key practice in cloud, microservices, and agile software delivery.

# What is DevOps Why DevOps & its History:

## pre-Coexist DevOps:

1. Requirement Gathering â€“ Understand what the client or user needs.
2. Design â€“ Plan the system architecture and software design.
3. Development â€“ Developers write code based on the design.
4. Testing â€“ QA team manually tests the software for bugs.
5. Deployment â€“ Operations team manually deploys code to production.
6. Maintenance â€“ Fix issues and release updates slowly and infrequently.

## why DevOps became necessary:

1. Slow Delivery â€“ Manual processes made software releases slow and inconsistent.
2. Team Silos â€“ Developers and operations worked separately, causing miscommunication.
3. Frequent Failures â€“ Manual deployments often led to errors and unstable systems.
4. Lack of Automation â€“ Repetitive tasks like testing and deployment were not automated.
5. Customer Demands â€“ Users wanted faster updates, better quality, and quick bug fixes.

## DevOps History

1. Before 2000s, development and operations worked in isolated silos.
2. In 2008, frustration with slow and error-prone releases grew in the tech community.
3. In 2009, Patrick Debois coined the term DevOps at the first DevOpsDays event in Belgium.
4. DevOps combined principles from Agile, Lean, and system administration.
5. Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Google popularized DevOps through automation and CI/CD.
6. Today, DevOps is a global standard for fast, reliable, and collaborative software delivery.

## What is DevOps: 

it's a culture that emphasizes the collabration between development and operations teams.
It's primary aim is to break down the silos that traditionly existed between these to teams,
thereby increasing efficiency,reducing errors,and emproving product quality.
DevOps incorporates everything from coading and source control to build processes,deployment,
and ongoing maintence.

## key practices:

1. CI/CD â€“ Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for faster releases.
2. Automation â€“ Automate testing, deployment, and infrastructure setup.
3. Monitoring & Logging â€“ Track system performance and issues in real time.
4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Manage servers and environments using code.
5. Collaboration â€“ Break silos between development, operations, and QA teams.
6. Version Control â€“ Use tools like Git to track and manage code changes.

## tools overview:

1. Version Control â€“ Git, GitHub, GitLab: Track and manage code changes.
2. CI/CD â€“ Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI: Automate build, test, and deployment.
3. Configuration Management â€“ Ansible, Puppet, Chef: Automate server setup.
4. Containerization â€“ Docker: Package apps with dependencies into containers.
5. Orchestration â€“ Kubernetes: Manage and scale containerized applications.
6. Monitoring â€“ Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack: Monitor system health and logs.
7. Cloud Platforms â€“ AWS, Azure, GCP: Host and scale infrastructure on the cloud.

## ðŸ“Œ **Quick Revision Note**:
1. DevOps = Collaboration + Automation + Monitoring + Continuous Feedback
2. Goal = Faster & Reliable software delivery
